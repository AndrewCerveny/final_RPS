### Learning Goals:
This project touched upon every concept learned in Mod 1. This dealt includes but not exclusive to: primitive data types, complex data types, event listeners, bubbling, css style sheets, javaScript and function building, external resource utilizing, and making something interactive thus rewarding for the time invested.  

### Wins + Challenges:
I had a hard time picturing what class - class interaction would look like for javascript. I reached out to a mentor who guided me into a different understanding. I also had a hard time starting, it seemed like such a daunting task I researched boiler plates for HTML just to break the ice. Lastly, I have a problem with being attached to code. When code takes hours to build, it becomes hard to look at that code and think how can this be better or refactored. I'm still working on getting through this.
